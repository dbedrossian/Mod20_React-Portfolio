## Background

*To learn how React works and to get practice in it,* we were instructed to make a portfolio page using React. It includes multiple tabs, loads as a single application, and links to many projects I've worked on over the semester.


## Install/Link to Webpage ðŸ”— 

Here's a link to the deployed application:

https://dbedrossian.github.io/Mod20_React-Portfolio/


And here's the repo link!:

https://github.com/dbedrossian/Mod20_React-Portfolio

## Usage

It'll be useful as a portfolio website once it's polished, so for now this is being used as an assignment project.
